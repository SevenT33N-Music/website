To enable this, click the nav button in the top right, which will open settings. There you can change the unicode options: click "disable". That should load emojis instead of icons.<br>I also fixed the link to my dark humor website, so you can actually open it now.

      <h2>WHERE DID HE GO?</h2> <!-- News Headline -->
      <br>
      <p>Hey everyone, I've got some explaining to do. I haven't been very active on my website, and I think it has poorly impacted the quality of the site. The truth is that I haven't been doing well emotionally. I've felt drained and tired, and my motivation was at an all-time low. For that reason, I decided to take a break from music production and my website. I needed to focus on my mental health, as it is so much more important than my music. I am back now, and I'm doing much better. My album "Static" should release in the next two weeks, but there are no guarantees.<br><br>As of right now, my song "Mekayla" is unlisted, so only those with the link can listen (If you want it to be public, you'll have to ask my friend to let me publicly release the song). Lastly, I am working on a form to add here, so you can easily contact me with questions, concerns, and suggestions.<br><br>P.S: You can listen to "Mekayla" here on the website</p> <!-- News -->
