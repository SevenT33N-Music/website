    <header>UPDATE LOG 1.2.0</header>
    <info>I have created a work-around for the bug on windows, which is to simply replace the original icons with emojis. To enable this, click the nav button in the top right, which will open settings. There you can change the unicode options: click "disable". That should load emojis instead of icons. I also fixed the link to my dark humor website, so you can actually open it now.</info>

    <header>UPDATE LOG 1.0.1</header>
    <info>I am aware of a bug on windows where the icons may not load. I've added "title" tags to the buttons, so you can simply hover your cursor over the buttons to see what the button does. I am also updating the layout of the "Music" page. Please be patient while I work, as it could take a few weeks.</info>
