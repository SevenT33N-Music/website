    <title> CHORD PROGRESSIONS </title>
    <intro> The term "chord progression" simply refers to the order that chords are played in a musical composition. How will you know which chords are the right fit for your song? In this tutorial, thats what we will be covering. So without further delay, lets get started! </intro>
    <body> There are a nearly infinite number of chord progressions, but most really dont sound all that great. So which ones should you use? Well, that depends on the mood you want to feel when playing or listening to the song. First, lets start with some emotional progressions (NOTE THAT ALL CHORD EXAMPLES ARE IN C MAJOR). The first, and by far most popular, is 6-4-1-5 (Am–F–C–G). The starting point of the progression doesnt matter, but this common starting point was "dubbed as the 'sensitive female chord progression' by Boston Globe columnist Marc Hirsh" (Wikipedia). </body>
